# Errors and Debugging
Developing a backend integration for LiveArt HTML5 will always require debugging and looking for errors. Below are brief recommendations that will facilitate the development process.

* Use Net/Network tab of your favorite browser extensively to monitor what requests and responds are going through your integration;
* Use [Fiddler](http://www.telerik.com/fiddler) to capture and manipulate sessions and measure performance;
* Look into Console each time you encounter a missing functionality;

LiveArt does not validate response of the services in most of the cases, so make sure they are JSON and correspond the examples, provided with the trial or your build package.
