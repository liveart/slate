# Introduction

###Current version: 0.10.28

LiveArt HTML5 uses JSON format to transfer data, such as information about design, pricing and order, to backend. In order to prepare server-side application for work in pair with LiveArt component, backend services should be ready to receive and deliver valid data structures via HTTP queries. The detailed description of this queries and datatypes is given in the following article.

<aside class="warning">LiveArt HTML5 integration requires profound coding knowledge of GET/POST requests and JSON processing in your native platform. Regardless of the letter, we recommend constantly using Net Inspector and/or Fiddler tool to debug your requests and responses of the API.</aside>

Each request is normally sent as POST request with the payload, contained in `value` parameter. Sometimes additional parameters may include design id or timestamp. Using Inspector properly, you will be able to notice all information that is being sent.

All endpoint URLs can be both relative or absolute. For correct operation of the tool we advise using relative URLs more as you may get into CORS issue if your users will be accessing tool with a different URL than provided in main configuration file. A common example is accessing site with or without the `www`.

This service is used to get the price of a current design. It is called every time when end user is making some changes to the design or product selection.

To bind LiveArt HTML5 to the server side GetQuote service, you will need to define the getQuoteUrl property in config JSON. The value has to be a link to a backend service. See example below:

### Service definition in config.json
`"getQuoteUrl": "services/getQuote.php"`
<aside class="success">
If you need to switch off the pricing aspect of your application, simply leave `getQuoteUrl` empty!
